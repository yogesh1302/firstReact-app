NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for JavaScript, primarily used for managing libraries and dependencies in Node.js projects. 
It allows developers to easily install, update, and manage third-party packages from the NPM registry.

Key features of NPM include:

1. **Package Installation**: Developers can install packages from the NPM registry using simple commands. For example, `npm install <package-name>` installs the latest version of a package.

2. **Dependency Management**: NPM automatically manages package dependencies, ensuring that all required packages are installed and up to date.

3. **Version Control**: NPM allows developers to specify and manage package versions, making it easy to update or roll back to previous versions as needed.

4. **Scripts**: NPM enables the use of scripts to automate common tasks, such as testing, building, and deploying applications.

5. **Global and Local Packages**: Developers can install packages globally (available system-wide) or locally (specific to a project), providing flexibility in package management.

Overall, NPM is an essential tool for modern JavaScript development, streamlining the process of working with external libraries and dependencies.
